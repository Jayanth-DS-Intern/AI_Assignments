        "answer": "a) The organs labeled in the diagram are:\nA: Mouth/Oral cavity\nB: Esophagus\nC: Liver\nD: Stomach\nE: Pancreas\nF: Small and Large Intestines\n\nb) The stomach (D) plays a crucial role in the digestive process:\n- It acts as a temporary storage for food.\n- It secretes gastric juice containing hydrochloric acid and enzymes like pepsin.\n- The acid creates an acidic environment that kills many bacteria and begins protein breakdown.\n- Pepsin starts the digestion of proteins.\n- The stomach's muscular walls churn and mix the food with gastric juices, creating a semi-liquid mixture called chyme.\n- It regulates the release of chyme into the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter.\n\nc) The liver (C) and pancreas (E) contribute to digestion in the following ways:\n\nLiver (C):\n- Produces bile, which is stored in the gallbladder and released into the small intestine.\n- Bile emulsifies fats, breaking them into smaller droplets for easier digestion by pancreatic lipase.\n- Helps in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K).\n- Processes and stores nutrients absorbed from the digestive tract.\n- Detoxifies harmful substances in the blood coming from the digestive system.\n\nPancreas (E):\n- Produces pancreatic juice containing various digestive enzymes:\n  * Amylase: breaks down carbohydrates\n  * Lipase: digests fats\n  * Trypsin and chymotrypsin: digest proteins\n- Secretes bicarbonate to neutralize stomach acid in the small intestine, creating an optimal pH for pancreatic enzymes to work.\n- Produces hormones like insulin and glucagon that regulate blood sugar levels, which is crucial for proper metabolism of nutrients from digestion.",
