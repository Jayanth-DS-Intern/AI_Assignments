        "question": "a) Label parts 8, 9, 10, and 12 in the image.\nb) Describe the function of part 8 (the lens).\nc) Explain how parts 9 (cornea) and 10 (pupil) work together in the visual process.",
        "marks": "1",
        "answer": "a) Labels:\n8. Lens\n9. Cornea\n10. Pupil\n12. Iris\n\nb) Function of the lens (part 8):\nThe lens is a transparent, biconvex structure that helps to refract light and focus it onto the retina. It has the ability to change shape, a process called accommodation, which allows the eye to focus on objects at various distances. When the ciliary muscles contract or relax, they change the shape of the lens, making it more or less convex to adjust the focal length and maintain a clear image on the retina.\n\nc) How the cornea (part 9) and pupil (part 10) work together in the visual process:\nThe cornea and pupil work together as the first steps in the visual process:\n\n1. The cornea is the transparent front part of the eye that covers the iris, pupil, and anterior chamber. It acts as the eye's outermost lens, responsible for about two-thirds of the eye's total focusing power. It bends light to help focus it onto the retina.\n\n2. The pupil is the adjustable opening at the center of the iris that controls the amount of light entering the eye. It appears as a black circle in the center of the colored iris.\n\n3. When light enters the eye, it first passes through the cornea, which bends the light rays. The amount of light then passing through to the lens is regulated by the pupil. In bright light, the pupil constricts (gets smaller) to limit the amount of light entering the eye. In dim light, it dilates (gets larger) to allow more light in.\n\n4. After passing through the pupil, the light continues to the lens, which further focuses it onto the retina.\n\nBy working together, the cornea and pupil ensure that the appropriate amount of focused light enters the eye, which is crucial for clear vision and protecting the sensitive structures of the eye from damage due to excessive light exposure.",
