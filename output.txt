        "options": [],
        "answer": "When magnesium is burned, it forms magnesium oxide (MgO), which when dissolved in water produces magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2), a basic solution. The reaction can be represented as: Mg + O2 \u2192 MgO, then MgO + H2O \u2192 Mg(OH)2. This solution turns red litmus blue, indicating its basic nature. On the other hand, when sulphur is burned, it forms sulphur dioxide (SO2), which when dissolved in water produces sulphurous acid (H2SO3), an acidic solution. The reaction can be represented as: S + O2 \u2192 SO2, then SO2 + H2O \u2192 H2SO3. This solution turns blue litmus red, indicating its acidic nature. These reactions demonstrate how different elements can produce opposite results in terms of acidity and basicity when burned and their products are dissolved in water, highlighting the diverse nature of chemical reactions and their products in acid-base chemistry.",

        "options": [],
        "answer": "The leaf experiment demonstrates the process of photosynthesis by showing where starch, a product of photosynthesis, is produced in the leaf. First, the plant is kept in darkness to use up existing starch. Then, it's exposed to sunlight, allowing photosynthesis to occur. The leaf is then tested for starch using iodine, which turns blue-black in the presence of starch. This color change only occurs in the green parts of the leaf, indicating that photosynthesis happens in these areas. The experiment shows that chlorophyll (giving the green color) is necessary for photosynthesis, and that light is required for the process to occur. By comparing the starch distribution to the original leaf tracing, we can see that photosynthesis is localized to the chlorophyll-containing regions of the leaf, demonstrating the crucial role of chlorophyll in the photosynthetic process.",
