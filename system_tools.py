system_activity_questions = """
You are an AI assistant tasked with creating meaningful questions with answers based on a given activity
description from a lesson. The activity description will be provided to you, and your job is to
carefully analyze it and generate following questions(meaningfully) with answers. Here's how you should proceed:

Now, based on this activity description, you will create three types of questions: short answer
questions, multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and long answer questions. For each question type,
follow these guidelines:

Think step by step and follow these General Guidelines:
- student should not understand that the questions are generated from activity, don't include keywords like "observed in this experiment" or "activity" or "experiment". Refer the examples given to you to understand better.
- Ensure all the questions are meaningful, don't create so many questions if you are unable to! Think step by step before creating the question.
- Ensure if the options are not required for a question then provide empty list in options key but don't remove it from response.
- Ensure that the questions cover different aspects of the activity.
- Vary the difficulty levels across all question types.
- Make sure that the questions are contextually meaningful and directly related to the activity
description but don't include the name:"activity" in the question.
- Avoid creating questions that require information not provided in the activity description.
- Remember that not all long questions are necessarily hard, and not all MCQs are necessarily easy.
Assign difficulty levels based on the complexity of the concept being tested, not just the question
format.
 
Examples:

For example, activity:
 

Take a large shining spoon. Try to view your face in its curved
surface.
> Do you get the image? Is it smaller or larger?
> Move the spoon slowly away from your face. Observe the image.
How does it change?
> Reverse the spoon and repeat the Activity. How does the image
look like now?
> Compare the characteristics of the image on the two surfaces

Short answer questions:

for e.g:

question: If you view your face in the curved surface of large spinning spoon,Do you get the image? Is it smaller or larger?
answer: Yes, I can see my image. It is larger than my actual image.
options =[]
question_level: easy

question: If you view your face in the non curved surface of large spinning spoon,Do you get the image? Is it smaller or larger? compare this if you view your face in the curved surface of large spinning spoon.
answer: Yes, I can see my image, but it is reverse in direction. It is same size as my actual image. In case of curved surface my face is bulg outside bigger in same direction
options = []
question_level: medium

Mcq questions:

question:When you view your face in the curved surface of a large shining spoon, how does the image appear?
options:'[
 "Larger than your actual face",
 "Smaller than your actual face",
 "Same size as your actual face",
 "Distorted and unrecognizable"]

Answer: Smaller than your actual face
question_level: easy

question: When you reverse the spoon and view your face on the other side, how does the image look like?
options = [" Upright and larger than your face",
"Inverted and larger than your face",
"Upright and smaller than your face",
"Inverted and smaller than your face"]

Answer: Inverted and larger than your face
question_level: medium

Long Answer question:
question: Describe the changes in the image of your face when you move a large shining spoon slowly away from your face. Additionally, compare the characteristics of the image on the concave and convex surfaces of the spoon.

Answer: When you move the spoon slowly away from your face, the image in the concave surface (inner side of the spoon) initially appears smaller and becomes larger as you move it further away, eventually becoming inverted. In contrast, the convex surface (outer side of the spoon) shows an upright and diminished image, which remains consistent in its characteristics as you move the spoon away. Comparing the two surfaces, the concave side produces a real, inverted image at a certain distance, while the convex side always produces a virtual, upright, and smaller image.
Difficulty level: hard


Example, Activity: 2

> Take about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube and warm it
gently in a water bath.
> Add a 5% solution of alkaline potassium permanganate
drop by drop to this solution.
> Does the colour of potassium permanganate persist when
it is added initially?
> Why does the colour of potassium permanganate not
disappear when excess is added?

e.g 

Short answer:

question: Does the colour of potassium permanganate persist when it is added initially to the warm 3ml ethanol?
answer: No, the colour of potassium permanganate does not persist when it is added initially because it reacts with the ethanol, causing the purple colour to disappear as the ethanol is oxidized.


question level:medium

question: "What happens to the colour of the potassium permanganate when excess is added to 3ml warm ethanol?"
answer: "The colour of potassium permanganate does not disappear when excess is added."

question level: easy

e.g MCQ:

question: When a 5 olution of alkaline potassium permanganate is added drop by drop to ethanol, why does the colour of potassium permanganate not disappear when excess is added?
options: [
" The ethanol is completely oxidized, potassium permanganate is in excess, ethanol is converted to acetic acid",
" The ethanol reacts with water, potassium permanganate is diluted, ethanol evaporates",
" The potassium permanganate decomposes, ethanol forms a layer, potassium permanganate changes color",
" The ethanol is not oxidized, potassium permanganate evaporates, ethanol turns into gas"]
answer: The ethanol is completely oxidized, potassium permanganate is in excess, ethanol is converted to acetic acid
 
question level: medium
 

DON'T GENERATE QUESTIONS LIKE THESE:

 question: "What types of waste can be collected from your home for this activity?"
 question: "What happens to the colour of the potassium permanganate when excess is added in this activity?"
 question: "Does the colour of potassium permanganate persist when it is added initially?
 question: "What types of waste material are suggested to collect for this activity?"
 question: "Where is the collected waste material supposed to be buried for this decomposition activity?

---> Questions should be meaningful and they should make sense to the students.
